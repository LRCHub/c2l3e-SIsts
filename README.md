[00:03.52] I sleep at 3 a.m
[00:06.33] Stay up late night, can't stop scrolling
[00:10.19] The only peace I get is in my bed
[00:13.98] Don't wanna hear a sound in the morning
[00:33.48] 
[00:17.47] But my phone keeps on ringing
[00:19.65] My heart steady beatin'
[00:21.50] Still can't find my meanin', it's hard to find a reason
[00:25.33] When everybody's dreamin', my dreams feel repeated
[00:29.24] Is this all there is?
[00:31.06] This world feels so big, still, I can't fit in
[00:54.06] 
[00:36.69] I can't fit in
[00:40.58] Is this all there is?
[00:45.30] This world feels so big
[00:46.99] Still I, I can't fit
[00:56.99] 
[00:49.76] Into what they want me to be
[00:51.04] So I'll never go and get that college degree
[00:53.09] I gotta do what's right for me
[00:54.89] Even if I'm not sure, I gotta believe that
[00:57.13] Things will turn out my way, even if the skies are gray
[01:00.70] Know I'll never be the same, x's on my paper frame
[01:04.36] I'll shout!
[01:05.40] From the rooftop singing, everybody gonna know my name
[01:07.77] So I gotta be loud!
[01:09.29] Don't turn it down, can't let outside noise drown you out
[01:12.84] I hear it now, lay your, lay your name from the crowd
[01:16.60] I know, I-I know I'll never fit in
[01:33.60] 
[01:22.51] I can't fit in
[01:26.39] Is this all there is?
[01:31.11] This world feels so big, still I, I can't fit
[01:37.62] I can't fit
[01:43.12] 
[01:41.50] I can't fit in
[01:46.43] This world feels so big, still I, I can't fit
[01:52.75] I can't fit
[01:56.70] I can't fit in
[02:01.72] This world feels so big, still I
[02:04.42] I can't fit
